Vision Transformer Implementation
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification, inspired by the paper An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. It adapts the transformer architecture, initially designed for NLP tasks, to computer vision by processing images as sequences of patches.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the CIFAR-10 dataset used for training and testing.
checkpoint/: Stores model checkpoints for resuming training.
models/: Includes implementation files for the Vision Transformer components:
MHSelfAttention.py: Multi-head self-attention mechanism.
PositionEncoding.py: Adds positional encoding to image patch embeddings.
TransformerBlock.py: Implements a single transformer block.
SimpleTransformer.py: Assembles the Vision Transformer architecture.
PatchEmbedding.py: Converts image patches into embedding vectors.
Utils.py: Prepares CIFAR-10 data loaders and applies image preprocessing (resizing and normalization).
VisionTransformer_main.py: Main script for training and evaluating the model.
TrainValidateWrapper.py: Wraps the Vision Transformer model for training and validation.
Installation
cd VisionTransformerGA
Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install torch torchvision 
Ensure GPU support is enabled for PyTorch if available.
Dataset
The model uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes. Images are resized to 224x224 and normalized for compatibility with the Vision Transformer architecture.

How It Works
Patch Embedding: Each 224x224 image is divided into 16x16 patches, flattened, and embedded into vectors.
Positional Encoding: Positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings.
Transformer Layers: A sequence of transformer layers processes the patch embeddings.
Classification Token: A special token is prepended to the input sequence for classification.
Training and Validation: The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and validated for accuracy.
Training
To train the model:

bash
python VisionTransformer_main.py
Key parameters:

NUM_EPOCHS: Number of training epochs (default: 20).
BATCH_SIZE: Batch size (default: 16).
LEARNING_RATE: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 1e-4).
The model achieves ~50% accuracy with 20 epochs and ~73% accuracy with 200 epochs.

Resuming Training
Set RESUME_TRAINING = True in VisionTransformer_main.py to load the latest checkpoint from the checkpoint/ folder and continue training.

Results
The model outputs classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Training logs and the best model are saved in the checkpoint/ directory.
